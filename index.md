### Mapping Monuments & Memory Across the Former Yugoslavia pairs journalism with landscape architecture to tell the story of the "Spomeniks", futuristic socialist modernist WWII-monuments and memorial complexes scattered across the six former republics of Yugoslavia.

The Spomeniks are found throughout villages and remote landscapes. Secular totems that were meant to encapsulate the idea and unity of the new socialist and multicultural federation of Yugoslavia. The abstract visual language does not cater to one ethnic group and to promote an overarching Yugoslav identity after the atrocities of World War II.

The memorial complexes were built in the 1960’s and 1970’s to commemorate the fight against fascism in Yugoslavia, and are important cultural landmarks from that era. They are situated on historic sites – where famous battles took place, on former concentration camp sites and other sites of atrocious killings and crimes during WWII.
