# Mapping Monuments & Memory

Site created to house the work of Jørgen Samsø and Mark Thomann for their 2015-2016 Magic Grant.

If your (Mac) computer is not set up for development, refer to the first file in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/amccartney/87fb7e148969431b6d9cb2d51ed5d510#file-1-housekeeping-md) to get your computer ready to handle Jekyll. Otherwise, continue below.

To run site locally, you must have [bundler](http://bundler.io/). If not, run:

`$ gem install bundler`

Clone and `cd` into the directory. Run:

`$ bundle install`

Then start the local server on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) with:

`$ bundle exec jekyll serve`

# Jekyll admin

This site uses Jekyll admin, which means that when running the site locally, you can visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:4000/admin) to edit any of the pages in markdown in an easy-to-use CMS.

All content pages can be found in the 'pages' directory in the CMS.
