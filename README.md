## Mapping Monuments & Memory

Site created to house the work of Jorgan Samso and Mark Thomann for their 2015-2016 Magic Grant.

To run site locally, you must have [bundler](http://bundler.io/). If not, run:

`$ gem install bundler`

Clone and `cd` into the directory. Run:

`bundle install`

Then start the local server on [http://127.0.0.1:4000/](http://127.0.0.1:4000/) with:

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Jekyll admin

This site uses Jekyll admin, which means that when running the site locally, you can visit [http://127.0.0.1:4000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:4000/admin) to edit any of the pages in markdown in an easy-to-use CMS.

All content pages can be found in the 'pages' directory in the CMS.
